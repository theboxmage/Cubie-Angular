# Cubie
The goal of this project is to be a tool to teach the CFOP Speedcubing process. To help clarify questions or concerns, this project will render a Cube on the screen to help a new user follow along on algorithms. Hopefully, this will allow an easier transition from reading algorithms to understanding how perform them on the cube.
